How to run in Linux machine:

1. you need to have rlwrap (source: http://freecode.com/projects/rlwrap).
rlwrap is a readline wrapper, a small utility that uses the GNU readline library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any other command. It maintains a separate input history for each command, and can TAB-expand words using all previously seen words and/or a user-specified file.

2. you need to have oracle 'basic', 'sqlplus', 'devel' versions installed to your machine.
